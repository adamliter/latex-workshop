Many thanks to both Alan Munn and Kenneth Hanson for reading over early drafts of this handout and providing useful feedback and suggestions.
Moreover, I also owe many thanks to the TeX.SX community for being a great resource, for helping me to learn a lot about \LaTeX, and, perhaps most importantly, for being a great community consisting of a bunch of friendly folks.
