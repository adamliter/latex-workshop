Many thanks to both Alan Munn and Kenneth Hanson for reading over early drafts of this handout and providing useful feedback and suggestions.
Thanks also to Joseph Wright for help with sorting out the problems with the previously untested and broken commands in Listings~\ref{lst:Windows-make-TEXMFHOME},~\ref{lst:Windows-make-TEXMFHOME-in-Dropbox},~and~\ref{lst:Windows-make-local-texmf-MiKTeX}.
Moreover, I also owe many thanks to TeX.SX for being a great resource, for helping me to learn a lot about \LaTeX, and, most importantly, for being a great community consisting of a bunch of friendly folks. \resizebox*{!}{1em}{\rubberduck}
